			My name is Alfvar Arvidsson. I'm a budding <b>UX designer</b> currently doing my bachelor's
			degree at Halmstad University. I'm interested in
			<b>service design, UI design, and UX research,</b>
			to name a few things. You can e-mail me at
			<a href="mailto:hello@alfvar.com" class="p" style="text-decoration:underline;"> hello@alfvar.com </a>
			if you want to get in touch.

			I love working in teams. I was the guy who went to school on the days when I was finished with
			my assignment, just to hang with my classmates. I tend to get visions of ideas quickly but I always
			make sure the team is on board and understands what I mean before proceeding with anything.
			<br />
			<br />
			When I'm not working on school assignments, I'm usually working on my own projects. I've barely
			ever found anything that doesn't capture my interest (except sports!). I grew up playing with a
			digital camcorder and Windows Movie Maker, and I focused on different forms of media production
			all through high school. I used to produce music under the alias

			I love cooking and have a passion for copper and carbon steel cookware. I've also dabbled in microcontrolleres
			and Raspberry Pi's on occasion.
