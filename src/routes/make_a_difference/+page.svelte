		<h3>The brief</h3>

		<p class="text longtext">
			When Russia invaded Ukraine in the spring of 2022, everyone wanted to help, but the logistics
			of humanitarian organizations only supported donations of money. Individuals who wanted to
			contribute with their engagement or items went unappreciated and had nowhere to turn to. The
			origin of this observation came from HighFive, an independent growth department of Halmstad
			county in Sweden.
			<br />
		</p>
		<br />

		<h3>The challenge</h3>
		<p class="longtext text">
			As it turned out, most humanitarian organizations actually contribute in other countries,
			rather than aiding Swedish refugees when they have arrived. Since money is very easy to move,
			individuals didn't receive the opportunity to contribute with items or engagement. Some
			positions also required a verification including criminal records (adressing human trafficking concerns), which made aid from
			individuals a <span class="highlight-container"
				><span class="highlight">bigger commitment</span></span
			>
			than it had to be.
