			When Russia invaded Ukraine in the spring of 2022, everyone wanted to help, but the logistics

			<h3>Background</h3>

			<p class="text longtext">
				The client for this project was HighFive, an independent growth department of Halmstad
				county in Sweden. Their response to the invasion was quick, so this project was very
				relevant to current events. Despite this, the implications could go way further than this
				(hopefully) temporary use case. HighFive wanted to create a platform where people could find
				ways to help, and organizations could find people to help them. This would happen through
				requests for items and skills, and individuals would fulfill them. A few initial questions
				immediately came to mind:
			</p>

		<div class="text text25">
			<ul class="handwriting">
				<li class="handwriting">Why doesn't this service exist?</li>
				<li class="handwriting">What do the humanitarian organizations want?</li>
				<li class="handwriting">What do the helpers want?</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Making sense of things</h3>

			<p>
				Following some desktop research, we learned that most humanitarian organizations actually
				contributed in other countries, rather than aiding Swedish refugees when they have arrived
				here. Since money is relatively easy to move, individuals didn't receive the opportunity to
				contribute with other things. The question remained, why should all these people who were
				willing to contribute go unappreciated?
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the brief was rather loosely defined, we decided to discuss a more defined problem
				specification together with HighFive. We discussed what the unique value proposition would
				be appropriate compared to existing services, and concluded that the concept shouldn't be
				constrained to Halmstad county.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal as now clearly defined. We wanted to create a platform that would <span
					class="underline">make it easier</span
				>
				for humanitarian organizations <span class="underline">to share help requests</span> and for
				people to fulfill them. It was also important that the platform would make it easier for people
				to find out what they could do to help.
