	<h2>ENABLING FOR AID</h2>

	<p class="text text7 textlarge">
		In a team of 5 other students we tried to bridge the needs of humanitarian organizations and
		people's will to contribute with donations of items or engagement.

		This is a Design Studio project. That means it was carried through during class for Halmstad
		University. The client is still real and this project evolved organically with the client.

		<h3>The brief</h3>

		<p class="longtext text">
			When Russia invaded Ukraine in the spring of 2022, everyone wanted to help, but the logistics
			of humanitarian organizations only supported donations of money. Individuals who wanted to
			contribute with their engagement or items went unappreciated and had nowhere to turn to. The
			origin of this observation came from HighFive, an independent growth department of Halmstad
			county in Sweden.
			<br />
		</p>

		<h3>The challenge</h3>
		<p class="longtext text">
			As it turned out, most humanitarian organizations actually contribute in other countries,
			rather than aiding Swedish refugees when they have arrived. Since money is very easy to move,
			this was the reason why individuals didn't receive the opportunity to contribute with items or
			engagement. Some positions also required a verification including criminal records, which made
			aid from individuals a big commitment.

		<h3>The results</h3>

			More stuff will be here :)
