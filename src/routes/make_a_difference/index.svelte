        (i) This is a Design Studio project. That means it was carried through

        <br /> <br />The brief for this project began by explaining that people wanted to support Ukraine when they
        were invaded by Russia, in the spring of 2022. The establieshed workflows only supported 
        donations of money, while individuals who wanted to aid with their engagement or items went unappreciated.
